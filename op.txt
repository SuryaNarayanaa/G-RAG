   Abstractâ€”The optimization of deep neural networks for de-
   ployment on edge devices is a significant research area due to
   the demand for applications such as augmented reality, smart
   cameras, and autonomous navigation. However, deploying large
   deep learning models on edge devices poses challenges related to
   computational power, energy consumption, and latency. Pruning
   is a method to reduce the model size, accelerate inference, and
   save power. The objective of the paper is to propose the Neuro
   Prune algorithm and to apply it for the optimization of deep
   neural networks on edge devices. Efforts have been made to
   compare pruned and unpruned models. As a result, the pruned
   model has an accuracy increase of 0.22%.
