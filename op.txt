   Abstractâ€”The optimization of deep neural networks for de-
   ployment on edge devices is a significant research area due to
   the demand for applications such as augmented reality, smart
   cameras, and autonomous navigation. However, deploying large
   deep learning models on edge devices poses challenges related to
   computational power, energy consumption, and latency. Pruning
   is a method to reduce the model size, accelerate inference, and
   save power. The objective of the paper is to propose the Neuro
   Prune algorithm and to apply it for the optimization of deep
   neural networks on edge devices. Efforts have been made to
   compare pruned and unpruned models. As a result, the pruned
   model has an accuracy increase of 0.22%.
   I. INTRODUCTION
   The rise of intelligent systems, ranging from autonomous
   drones to augmented reality (AR) devices and smart surveil-
   lance cameras, has intensified the need for efficient deep neural
   network deployment on edge devices with constrained com-
   putational resources. While advanced deep learning models
   like YOLO, SSD, ResNet, and MobileNet excel in accuracy,
   their deployment on such devices is hindered by significant
   computational demands, large memory footprints, and high
   energy consumption. These challenges pose critical barriers to
   real-time applications and sustainable deployment.
   This paper builds on existing pruning techniques, includ-
   ing unstructured pruning, structured pruning, and approaches
   inspired by quantization, highlighting their strengths and lim-
   itations. In response to the challenges identified, we introduce
   Neuro Prune, a novel pruning approach that integrates princi-
